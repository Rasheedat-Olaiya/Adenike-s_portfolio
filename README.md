### Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the sales and profit for the latest and last year?
- What is the Sales by Category in 2016 and 2017?
- What is the Sales by Segment in 2016 and 2017?


### Data Analysis

Analysis was carried out using the Pivot table.


### Results/Findings


The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The sales for the latest year is higher than that of the last year as well as the profit.
2. Office supplies and Technology product categories are the best perfoming category across different states in terms of sales and profit.
3. California has the highest product sales.


### Recommendation


Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Focus on expanding and promoting products across various categories and segments.
- Invest in marketing and promotions in the early quarter of the year to maximize profit.
- Implement a customer segmentation strtegy to target high-LTV customers effectively.


### Limitations


I had to remove all null values  and duplicates from the table because they would have afftected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis.
